# Hi, I'm [Lenart](https://github.com/Lenart12) 👋

Welcome to my corner of the internet, where code meets chaos. This GitHub is a living proof of my experiments, side projects, and occasional bursts of productivity. 

## ✨ About Me
- 🧠 Probably overthinking something right now.
- ✈️ Trying to bring more tech in to the sky with my sailplane license.
- 🤖 Cheap embedded hardware, tech tinkering, and learning new stuff keep me going.
- 📡 Licensed radio amateur (Ham Radio enthusiast) exploring the world of waves, antennas, and DIY electronics.  
- 🧵 Deeply curious about compilers, operating systems, and the intricacies of how Linux ticks.  
- 🌱 A fan of open-source projects and the communities that make them thrive.  

## 📂 What You'll Find Here
- 🏫 My old projects that were mostly school assignments.
- 🛠️ WIP projects that may or may not be finished. Ever.
- 🌱 Random repositories where I learn new things, experiment, break them, and try again.
- ✨ Some fun ideas that turned into code. (and some that didn’t 😅)
